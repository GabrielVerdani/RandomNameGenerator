# Random Word Generator

This is a little project that I made to exercise my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.  
What this website does is generate a random word of a given length.  

I tried to make it not generate any weird or unspeakable word like "bgdwiqobdo",  
and I think that was the real challenge and where I did struggle the most.
